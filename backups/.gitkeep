# Backup Directory

This directory stores database backup files created by the backup scripts.

Backup files are automatically compressed and timestamped.

## File Naming Convention

- `foodmission_full_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz` - Full database backups
- `foodmission_data_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz` - Data-only backups  
- `foodmission_schema_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql.gz` - Schema-only backups

## Cleanup

Old backups are automatically cleaned up by the backup script, keeping the 10 most recent files.

## Security Note

Backup files may contain sensitive data. Ensure proper access controls and secure storage.
