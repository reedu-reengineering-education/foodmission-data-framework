# Cursor AI Assistant Rules for FoodMission Data Framework

## Code Change Policy
- **NEVER make code changes without explicit user consent**
- Always suggest solutions first and wait for approval before implementing
- When investigating issues, provide analysis and recommendations, not immediate fixes
- **ALWAYS update tests and documentation when code is updated**
  - Update or add unit tests for new/changed functionality
  - Update or add integration tests if applicable
  - Update API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) if endpoints change
  - Update README or relevant docs if behavior changes
  - Ensure all tests pass after changes

## Troubleshooting Approach
When looking for root causes:
1. Analyze the code to identify the issue
2. Explain what the issue likely is based on the code
3. Suggest possible solutions
4. Wait for user approval before making any changes

## Solution Proposal Guidelines
When proposing solutions, follow these principles in order of priority:
1. **Coding Best Practices:**
   - Clean Code principles (readability, maintainability, meaningful names)
   - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - SOLID principles
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Proper error handling
2. **Backend Development Best Practices:**
   - RESTful API design
   - Proper HTTP status codes
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Security considerations
   - Performance optimization
3. **NestJS Best Practices:**
   - Dependency Injection patterns
   - Module organization
   - Guard, Interceptor, and Middleware usage
   - Service layer separation
   - Repository pattern where appropriate
   - Proper use of decorators
4. **TypeScript Best Practices:**
   - Strong typing
   - Interface/type definitions
   - Proper use of generics
   - Type safety
   - Avoid `any` types

## General Guidelines
- Prefer suggesting changes over implementing them
- Ask for confirmation before modifying code
- Provide clear explanations of what needs to be changed and why
- When proposing solutions, reference relevant best practices
